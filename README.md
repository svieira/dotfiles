# Dotfiles

Just like it says on the tin, a collection of dotfiles.
Take what you like, please leave comments if I'm doing something horribly wrong.

## Installing

* Download [`install-dotfiles`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svieira/dotfiles/master/install-dotfiles)
* Verify that it is what you expect
* `chmod +x install-dotfiles`
* Set `$CONFIGDIR` if you want it to be something other than `$HOME/dotfiles`
* Set `$LOCAL_BIN` if you want the files in `bin/` to be symlinked to somewhere other than `~/.local/bin`
* `./install-dotfiles`
